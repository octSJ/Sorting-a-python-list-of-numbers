# Sorting-a-python-list-of-numbers
Using this python code we can sort a python list of numbers from the lowest number to the highest number and vice versa.
Very often we create a python list which contains a lot of numbers. For example if we store the obtained marks of students in an exam. 
In this situations we insert the numbers in a python list randomly. But we need the highest score and the lowest score.
In this case we can use this simple python code to get the sorted list to get the highest score and the lowest score simultaneously at the output lists.
We can also see how many people have got what scores.
